function serie_out=bl_window_smoothing(serie,time,window,smooth_function)

% BL_WINDOW_SMOOTHING: replaces each point by its averaging (or min, or median) within a window around that point.
% For fast computing, the method assumes that the data is equally spaced. When this is not the case, the result is an approximation.
% For large data gaps, a different method should be used such as a loop (much slower). 
% Note that the method builds a window * length(serie) matrix which may use a lot of RAM for a long time series.
% This function can be replaced by Matlab's native functions movmean and movmedian for the "mean" and "median" cases.
%
% serie_out = bl_window_smoothing(serie,time,window,smooth_function)
% 	e.g., serie_out = bl_window_smoothing(biolum,time,5/3600/24,'median');
%
% INPUTS: 
% 	serie: time series to be processed.
%	time: corresponding time vector. Can be of any unit (e.g., a depth vector for processing a vertical profile) or left empty (assumes regular intervals)
%	window: in the same unit as time (days if using matlab time format, number of points if time is left empty). 
%		The window will be adapted such that the corresponding number of points is an odd number (for symmetry around the data point).
%	smooth_function: function to be applied within the window. Available options are 'mean','median','min','max'.
%
% OUTPUTS: 
% 	serie_out: new, processed time series.
